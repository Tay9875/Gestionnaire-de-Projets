## Installation
Recommendation: a Notepad based app (I used Sublime Text) / VScode

This folder has quie a lot of files to use, and that could be a bit more oraganized but it does mos of the job just fine.

So the main code that is made of php and css (that I should have put in a css folder) is going to be directly in the project folder.
Int the project folders you'll find different folders consisting of API php code and the necessary images that are called in the code.
For the BITMAPs, you'll need to create a "isometricTiles" folder in said project.
Normally, everything is set as i should be.
